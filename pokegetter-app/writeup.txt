- Challenges:

The biggest challenge that I had was finding out where to start with react.  While I understood most things with
using JavaScript to fetch the API and manipulate the html file, starting with react was much more confusing.
One of the problems I had was trying to use the examples in the class GitHub as a template, but that led to 
more confusion as there were a lot of unused files, and functions in different places, and trying to track what
was actually useful, and finding out what each part did was much more confusing.

-Overcoming Challenges:

Honestly, the thing that really helped me was working on the site with someone who understood and could much more
easily guide me through what each function did, why it does that, and what changing certain things does.  It helped
me understand how to pass and retrieve different values, where to fetch information through the API, as well as add
and change those elements.

-React or JavaScript?

Personally, the JavaScript was much easier for me to understand, but I realize that with JavaScript there's more tedious
and repetitive work, and it feels like React can be used to organize and write cleaner code for larger projects.
